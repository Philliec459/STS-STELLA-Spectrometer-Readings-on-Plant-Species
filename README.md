# STS-STELLA-Spectrometer-Readings-on-Plant-Species
This is a Science and Technology Society (STS) of Sarasota-Manatee Counties that shows the data from a series of NASA STELLA-Q2 Spectrometer readings on a number of vegetative species.

In our Jupyter Notebook we load the raw STELLA-Q2 spectrometer data, white card correct the wavelength data and then use Decision Tree and Knn to differentiate plant species based on the mean end member data. NDVI is key to this analysis. 

In addition, we use a novel method using python's Altair to show the plant species target images along the NDVI time-series data for all the spectrometer readings.
